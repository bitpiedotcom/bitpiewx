Fellow Bitpiers,<br/>
Bitpie and TRON have announced deep ecological cooperation in all aspects.
It is reported, TRON will launch virtual machine on May 25, mainnet on May 31(UTC+8), token migration on June 21 and the first 27 super representative elections on June 26(UTC+8). With this date approaching, today Bitpie Wallet announced that it would support the TRON blockchain upgrade and token migration. By then, investors only need to deposit TRX’s ERC-20 tokens to Bitpie Wallet and will receive the equivalent TRX token. For TRX holders who deposit TRX in Bitpie Wallet after June 21st, there will be a weekly exchange. 
TRX/SCNY, TRX/ETH trading pairs are now available on the built-in exchange platform ExPie for trading. You can start depositing and trading TRX now. 



Risk warning: cryptocurrency investment is subject to high market risk. Please make your investments cautiously. Bitpie will make best efforts to choose high quality coins, but will not be responsible for your investment losses.
