Dear users

As a decentralized wallet, Bitpie Wallet do not hold any users’ assets, which are all taken care of by users themselves. Users assets are in blockchain network, only when a user takes good care of the SEED phrase/mnemonic can he guarantee assets safety. Therefore, we have reminded users repeatedly to backup and keep the SEED phrases/mnemonics well（the latest reminder was pushed by sticking on the top of Bitpie App a week before the certificate issue）.

After the revocation of the certificate by Apple Inc., we immediately released a notification informing the users not to uninstall the Bitpie App and advising users to recover the account in Android devices. Unfortunately, there are still some users failed to follow the announcement. As a follow-up, we are releasing this document to help users who failed to do so.

If you are an affected user, please follow the instructions below to recover your assets.<br/>
Case 1: if you have the SEED phrase/mnemonic, you can recover your account anytime on an Android version Bitpie app or IOS Appstore version with this SEED phrase/mnemonic.<br/>
Case 2: if you are not sure that you have backed up well your SEED phrase/mnemonic, and you did not uninstall Bitpie App, please send an email to us to secure the recovery procedure. Your account will be safely recovered under the help of our staff. We will contact you in accordance with the sequence of emails received.<br/>
Case 3: if you have uninstalled Bitpie App, and you did not back up well your SEED phrases/mnemonics, please check your iOS system version. Since your private key is stored in local Keychain of iOS system (All major iOS wallets are applicable to this method as well). Hence, if your system can be jailbroken, it might be possible to recover your assets, please check whether your iOS version can be jailbroken. If yes, please email us. We will try to help you recover your account. If your iOS version cannot be jailbroken at now, please wait until jailbroken is available on your iOS version; (anyhow, DO NOT upgrade, initialize or clear date of your iOS system for it will increase the difficulty of jailbreak).<br/>

The iOS version Bitpie app on AppStore is still usable though it’s an older one. For the time being, we are actively communicating with Apple Inc. and expecting the latest version to be listed soon. 

Customer Service Address: <a href="mailto://guozixxg@bitpie.com">guozixxg@bitpie.com</a><br/>
(Fraud alert：If you received emails from so-called Bitpie staff, please check the domain name suffix. If it’s not @bitpie.com, DO NOT reply. We will not and never ask you for any information related to SEED phrases/mnemonics).
