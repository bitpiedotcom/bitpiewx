Fellow Bitpiers,


The eosDAC community recently declared that eosDAC tokens will be migrated to the EOS mainnet once launched. The eosDAC holders should move their assets to the EOS mainnet before 06:59:59(GMT+8) June 2nd 2018, or else they may lose their eosDAC.


To ensure you get your eosDAC on the EOS mainnet as scheduled, we hereby announce that Bitpie supports the EOS public key mapping.(mapping tutorial: <a href="http://docs.bitpie.com/en/latest/commonContract/index.html" target="_blank" style="color:red" >click</a>)


Two ways to get your eosDAC on the EOS mainnet:<br/>
1. Keep your eosDAC (ERC20 tokens) on an Ethereum address of Bitpie that has been registered through the EOS Crowdsale contract before 06:59:59(GMT+8) June 2nd 2018. (Click for Details) (mapping tutorial: <a href="http://docs.bitpie.com/en/latest/commonContract/index.html" target="_blank" style="color:red" >click</a>)<br/>
2. If you keep your eosDAC (ERC20 tokens) on an unregistered Ethereum and transfer it afterwards, you can still get your eosDAC assets based on the EOS mainnet – It may take some time to get a smooth process in place and the eosDAC website will later give detailed steps.


The Bitpie team advises everyone to map the public address.


Attention: If you keep your eosDAC on an exchange or centralized platform that does not support the migration to the EOS mainnet, you will definitely lose your eosDAC. <a href="https://steemit.com/eos/@eosdac/how-eosdac-tokens-will-move-to-the-eos-chain" style="color:red" target="_blank">Click</a> for more information on how to get your eosDAC on the EOS Mainnet


Attention: For users who have EOS in Bitpie Wallet, please register by yourself before 06:59:59(GMT+8) June 2nd 2018.


ERC20 token is kind of a “temporary EOS”, so you will not get the “real EOS” on the EOS mainnet without mapping. We detected that there are currently a number of Bitpie users who haven’t done mapping, among which many have several millions of EOS assets. We have informed our users through various channels as we can, and please forward this message to others to make sure they register as scheduled.


For users who keep EOS in Bitpie Wallet, please register by yourself before 06:59:59(GMT+8) June 2nd 2018. Bitpie Wallet does not have its users’ private key so we cannot do mapping on behalf of you. Please complete this operation manually as soon as possible!(<a href="http://docs.bitpie.com/en/latest/commonContract/index.html" target="_blank" style="color:red" >click</a> here for help)
